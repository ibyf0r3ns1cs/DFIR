.SYNOPSIS
This script checks if running processes are signed and prints information about unsigned processes including their name, full path, and hash.

.DESCRIPTION
The script retrieves a list of running processes and iterates through each process. It calculates the hash of the process file and checks if the process is signed using the Get-AuthenticodeSignature cmdlet. If the process is not signed, it prints the process name, full path, and hash.

.NOTES
- The script requires administrative privileges to access certain processes and their files.
- The digital signature check relies on the Get-AuthenticodeSignature cmdlet, which uses the digital signature information available in the system.
- Some processes may not have a valid path or their files may not be accessible due to permission restrictions. Such processes will be skipped.
- The script uses the SHA256 algorithm by default to calculate the hash of the process file. You can modify the $hashAlgorithm variable to use a different hash algorithm if needed.

.EXAMPLE
.\CheckUnsignedProcesses.ps1
Runs the script to check for unsigned processes and display information about unsigned processes.
